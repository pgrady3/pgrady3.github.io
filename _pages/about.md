Hi! My name is Patrick; I'm currently a Senior Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs where I work on computer vision and machine learning for embodied AI. I lead the Surface Touchpad project, which lets you to turn any tabletop into a laptop-style trackpad, using only the cameras on headset. I've been lucky enough to work on this project from its inception to [shipping](https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3-v85-ptc-can-turn-any-surface-into-a-virtual-keyboard/) as a beta feature! Before joining Meta, I finished a PhD in the Robotics department at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I was advised by [Charlie Kemp](https://charliekemp.com/) and [James Hays](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/). My research was in vision-based tactile sensing and robotic manipulation, and my work focused on understanding precisely how humans and robots manipulate the world through the lens of *contact*.

Before grad school at Georgia Tech, I did my undergrad at Duke in computer science and electrical engineering. I got to lead [Duke Electric Vehicles](http://www.duke-ev.org/), a team of undergraduates building ultra-efficient cars. During my tenure as president, we set the world record for [Most Fuel-Efficient Vehicle](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/duke-students-break-guinness-world-record-fuel-efficiency) at 14,573 MPG, and [Most Efficient Electric Vehicle](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/duke-student-team-wins-second-guinness-world-record-vehicle-efficiency) at 27,482 MPGe.

In my free time, I like to fly gliders. These are a type of airplane without an engine which use thermals and mountain wave to stay aloft. My longest flight is 9 hours and covered 500 miles, and I hold 21 Georgia and Washington records for soaring.
